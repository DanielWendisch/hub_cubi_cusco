Could not solve for environment specs
The following packages are incompatible
├─ quarto-cli does not exist (perhaps a typo or a missing channel);
├─ r-base 4.3.1**  is requested and can be installed;
├─ r-bayesprism is not installable because there are no viable options
│  ├─ r-bayesprism 0 would require
